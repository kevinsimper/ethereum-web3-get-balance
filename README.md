# ðŸ§³ Ethereum Web3 - Get Balance

A simple app to showcase web3.js on how to use the new `ethereum.enable()` and get the balance of the person account who is logged in.

It uses Parcel.js because it is a easy way to bundle dependencies. Parcel fails by default if you don't specify a newer version to compile to with browserlist, which I have done right here: https://github.com/kevinsimper/ethereum-web3-get-balance/blob/master/package.json#L16
